                    As 80 ports were opened, the enumeration was initiated, leading to the discovery of a website<br>hosted on one of them. While viewing the page source, a subdomain, data.analytical.htb,<br>was found where a login page had been hosted.

                    While navigating to the subdomain, a webpage hosting a login form of Metabase was encountered, I started the search for a Metabase vulnerability POC.<br><br>
                    While searching for Metabase vulnerabilities, it was discovered that it was vulnerable to CVE-2023–38646. After gaining an understanding of the vulnerability,<br>an attempt was made to exploit it using msfconsole.

                    The RPORT should be set to 80, and the RHOST should be set to data.analytical.htb. Additionally, the LHOST should be changed to your VPN IP address.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    After running the payload, the shell of Metabase was successfully obtained. Further enumeration inside the machine was run by using script linpeas.
                    <p class="script-container">
                        python3 -m http.server 80

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The Python server was initiated on the attack machine where linpease was located. Subsequently, within the machine,<br>the home directory of the user “metabase” was accessed, and linpease was downloaded<br>from the attacker machine.
                    <p class="script-container">
                        bash linepeas.sh

                <p class="paragraph">
                    After analyzing the results of linpeas, the username and password were discovered, and they were employed to log in via SSH.

                <h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    For the privilege escalation attempt, linpeas was downloaded onto the machine using a<br>Python server, and the script was executed.<br><br>
                    While reviewing the results of linpeas, it was discovered that the machine’s version was<br>Ubuntu 22.04.3. The search for vulnerabilities pertaining to this version was initiated.<br><br>
                    After extensive searching on Google, it was determined that the machine’s version was susceptible<br>to CVE-2023–2640 and CVE-2023–32629.
                    <p class="script-container">
                        unshare -rm sh -c "mkdir 1 u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 1/; setcap cap_setuid+eip 1/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=1,upperdir=u,workdir=w, m && touch m/*;" && u/python3 -c 'import pty; import os;os.setuid(0); pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
                    </p>
                    In my case, CVE-2023–2640 was effective, and root access was obtained.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    The root flag was found in the home directory of the root, and, ultimately, the root flag was located.
